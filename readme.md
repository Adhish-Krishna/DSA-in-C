## ðŸ“– **Overview**
Welcome to **DSA in C**, where I explore and implement various Data Structures and Algorithms.
Why the hell do I learn DSA in C? There are easier languages to learn DSA like Python, Java, C++. But learning DSA in C gives you a greater advantage and it builds your foundation in low level programming strongly. This repository is a growing collection of my learnings, challenges, and experiments with DSA using C. Itâ€™s designed to serve as a study guide, reference material, and an open-source contribution to anyone who wants to dive into the world of DSA.

## ðŸ’» **My Progress So Far**

- ðŸ“š **Data Structures implemented as of now:**:
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly)
  - Stack (Using Arrays and Linked Lists)
  - Queue (Simple Queue and Circular Queue using Arrays and Linked Lists)
  - Binary Trees(Binary Search Tree with Insertions and Search Operation)

- ðŸ”¢ **Algorithms implemented as of now:**:
  - Sorting (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, Counting Sort, Radix Sort, Selection sort)
  - Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search)
  - Selection Algorithm (Quick Select)

**Happy Coding!** ðŸ˜Š
